How do I simply run django?
===========================

nice and short django tutorial - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/

* install python 2
* install django (easy_install django or pip install django)
* python manage.py runserver - this runs server on http://localhost:8000/

The database used is SQLite, with database file in database/SQLite_db. Not sure that keeping database in git is a good idea =)

PS. http://localhost:8000/admin is the admin page. login/password is admin.
